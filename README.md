# calculator

7-13-25 22:57 - basically just started the project; I know this one is going to be insanely difficult as a beginner. It's a great way to end foundations though. I'm going to try to knock out a significant portion of it tonight!

7-14-25 0143 - got the unstyled layout of the calculator done and got the four math functions completed. the operate function though..i'm completely lost. nothing seems to work. hopefully it comes to me after some sleep.

7-14-25 23:03 - I think my issue yesterday was thinking that because the previous function would implicitly return the value that my operate/logic statement would do the same. Once I added return and fixed the variables, the operate function works! I work tomorrow but hopefully the next few nights I can keep adding to the project. This is definitely the hardest so far.

7-17-25 0209 - big breakthroughs tonight! Figured out how to loop through to add an event listener to every button for more concise code. Adding conditional logic to make each button have it's own function. Just need to finish those out tomorrow as it's late tonight. Also starting to think through/pseudocode the next steps to actual get this thing functioning. also, the calculator is incredibly ugly right now; I intend to style it once it's worthy.

7-17-25 2242 - more progress today. I wish I had more time to dig into this tonight because I feel like I'm flowing. I completed all of the buttons click events and now I'm working on how to extract the numbers and operator in order for the function to work. My plan is to incorporate a second display line where the initial math expression will go to above the return answer. I'm using the iphone calculator as an example. Things are starting to click but I have a ton more work to do. I figured out that maybe using a regular expression is the best way to extract stuff that I need but we technically haven't learned it yet. So I went ahead to the documentation and tried to piece together what I could. I don't want to just throw in code I don't fully understand but I think at this basic level it made sense. Anyway, I've got a packed weekend and weird work weeks coming up but I'm hoping I can knock this project out in the next week or two. Stoked!
