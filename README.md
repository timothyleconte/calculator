# calculator

7-13-25 22:57 - basically just started the project; I know this one is going to be insanely difficult as a beginner. It's a great way to end foundations though. I'm going to try to knock out a significant portion of it tonight!

7-14-25 0143 - got the unstyled layout of the calculator done and got the four math functions completed. the operate function though..i'm completely lost. nothing seems to work. hopefully it comes to me after some sleep.
